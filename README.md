<b>AIM:</b> Create an Android Application that includes Login and Registration screens using Jetpack Compose.<br>
<b>Describe:</b> This project aims to demonstrate how to design and implement user authentication screens using Jetpack Compose, the modern UI toolkit for Android.
The application provides two main features:<br>
A Login screen where existing users can enter their credentials (email and password) to access the app.<br>
A Registration screen that allows new users to create an account by entering details such as name, email, and password.<br>
Navigation between both screens is handled using the Navigation Component in Compose. The project focuses on UI design, input validation, state management, and maintaining a smooth user experience without using traditional XML layouts. <br>
